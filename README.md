It's front-end for the conductor app on https://app.deus.finance.


The conductor will be used to introduce a new asset class to the ethereum blockchain.

The derivatives market, a financial Goliath
A derivative is a contract between parties whose value is pegged to an underlying financial asset or a set of assets. The underlying assets could be anything that has a value, be it currencies, stocks, or commodities.
The notional value of the entire derivatives market is around $558.5 trillion! And that’s a low-end estimate. By comparison, the total cryptocurrency market cap is currently around $349 billion.
To help you wrap your head around the sheer size, take a look at this infographic by Visual Capitalist.
The Registrar
At DEUS finance, we wanted to reimagine this crucial financial instrument by borrowing the concept from traditional finance and implementing it on the blockchain.
Registrars are decentralized tools that behave similarly to derivatives but leveraging smart contract technology. They utilize a real-time price feed of any asset or basket of assets gathered from oracles and create a new kind of asset class, whose price correlates with the underlying asset. The constant price correlation is achieved through an automated internal pricing mechanism.
The Registrars are backed by the DEUS ecosystem’s treasury & reserve, and by the balancing mechanism of our governance token, DEA.
Registrars enable investors to trade any real-world asset on decentralized blockchains. They will be chain-agnostic, meaning we can quickly implement them on any chain!

Who gets to create Registrars?
At launch, the DAO will create the pilot contract, which enables users to create Registrars for QQQ and Tesla stocks. Registrars for the S&P 500, NASDAQ, and DAX will eventually become available.
Over time, variety will increase, and anyone will be able to create Registrars through our platform. To ensure sustainable growth their implementation has to happen gradually, and there will be limits on how many Registrars can exist at once.
Limitless possibilities
Imagination is the only limit. There can be millions of different Registrars, with different underlying assets. We aim to lift the barriers, allowing anyone to access the entire financial world in just a few clicks.
